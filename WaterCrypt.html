            <p>A <strong>smart meter</strong> is automated equipment installed in smart home for calculating the energy consumption of
            various commodities such as gas, water, and electricity (<strong>Sun</strong> et <em><abbr title= "and others">al.</abbr></em>). It receives pricing information and
                load forecasting from the utility company while displaying all the information in the in-home-display (<em><abbr title= "in-home-display">IHD</abbr></em>)
                (<strong>Asghar</strong> et <em><abbr title= "and others">al.</abbr></em>).</p>

            <p>In the proposed scheme, a residential area with multiple smart homes is considered, where multiple <em>SMs</em>
            are used. The usage data is recorded in the <em>SMs</em> periodically. The entire system consists of four entities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Smart Meters (<em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SMs</abbr></em>)</li>
                <li>Encryption server (<em><abbr title= "Encryption server">ES</abbr></em>)</li>
                <li>Data Aggregator (<em><abbr title= "Data Aggregator">DA</abbr></em>)</li>
                <li>Control Center (<em><abbr title= "Control Center">CC</abbr></em>)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SM</abbr></em> is responsible for embedding the watermark in the original data and sending to the 
            <em><abbr title= "Encryption server">ES</abbr></em>. <em><abbr title= "Encryption server">ES</abbr></em> encrypts
            the watermarked data and sends it back to <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SM</abbr></em>. Before sending the data to <em><abbr title= "Data Aggregator">DA</abbr></em>, <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SMs</abbr></em> preprocess it.
            After receiving data from all the <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SMs</abbr></em>, <em><abbr title= "Data Aggregator">DA</abbr></em> aggregates the watermarked encrypted data and sends it to <em><abbr title= "Control Center">CC</abbr></em>
            eventually. <em><abbr title= "Control Center">CC</abbr></em> decrypts and extracts the total consumption data after verification and stores it for future
            analysis.</p>

            <p>An attacker can try to gain unauthorized access to <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SM</abbr></em> data for various dishonest purposes. We denote
                the attacker as <em>A</em>, where he/she may attempt the following attacks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eavesdropping</strong>: A can eavesdrop on the transmission channel between the system entities to access
                    daily lifestyle and behavior of the user for crime purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the middle</strong> attack (<em><abbr title= "Man-in-the-middle">MitM</abbr></em>): A can intercept the messages sent between the system entities to
                    retrieve, discard, or modify the <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SM</abbr></em> data.</li>
                <li><strong>Replay</strong> attack: A can perform replay attacks on the network to resend, replay or delay an <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SM</abbr></em>’s report
                    maliciously.</li>

            <h2><u>Conclusion and Future Work</u></h2>
            <p>This paper presents the novel <strong>WaterCrypt</strong> scheme for privacy preserving data aggregation based on
            reversible watermarking and <strong>Paillier</strong> encryption. A reversible watermarking approach is used to preserve
            the integrity of the user fine grained data. Considering that can provide well-grounded security to the data
            in one hand, and the limited computational capability of <em><abbr title= "Smart Meters">SMs</abbr></em> on the other hand, we introduced another
            entity in the system: encryption server. </p>
            <p> The <strong>WaterCrypt</strong> protocol provably protects the system from various 
            attacks such as eavesdropping, replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and masquerading. Physical attacks like false data injection
            are also taken into consideration. Moreover, the computational time is significantly small. Using reversible
            watermarking, the <strong>WaterCrypt</strong> protocol performs better than other recent schemes. After analyzing the
            security and privacy requirements and evaluating performance, it can be concluded that we have
            successfully implemented a suitable and secure scheme for resource-constrained smart metering
            systems.</p>
            <p>For future work, the focus will be on high frequency smart meters where the usage data are generated
            very frequently. We aim to employ reversible watermarking using difference expansion for this kind of
            smart metering systems.</p>
